📂 Code Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Data Loading
Reads the CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
Verifies shape, column names, and data types

---

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Checks for missing values and duplicates
Ensures correct data types for numerical analysis
Prepares categorical variables for grouping

---

3️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
Computes summary statistics for purchase amount
Measures central tendency and variability

---

4️⃣ Distribution & Normality Analysis
Visualizes purchase amount distribution
Tests for normality to validate parametric tests

---

5️⃣ Hypothesis Testing (t-test)
Compares the mean purchase amounts between gender groups
Tests statistical significance at 95% confidence level

---

7️⃣ Correlation Analysis
Measures the relationship between age and purchase amount
Supports analysis with scatter plots

---

8️⃣ Confidence Interval Calculation
Estimates the true population mean of the purchase amount
Uses Z-score for 95% confidence interval

Key concepts used:
mean ± z * (std / √n)
